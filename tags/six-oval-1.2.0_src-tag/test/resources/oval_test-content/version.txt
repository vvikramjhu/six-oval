* Changed the datatype of the chg_allow and exp_warn entities from "string" to "int" to resolve validation errors in the unix-def_shadow_test.xml files. 
* Added platform specific OVAL Variables Documents to align with the OVAL Variable identifiers in each of the oval-def_external_variable.xml files. 
* Changed the linux-def_selinuxboolean_test.xml file so that it specified the var_ref property instead of the entity_check property. 
* Added "independent-definitions-schema" to the schemaLocation attribute of the oval_definitions element to resolve validation errors. 
* Changed the datatypes and operations of the local_port object and state entities in the linux-def_inetlisteningservers_test.xml file to resolve validation errors. 
* Changed the datatypes and operations of the local_port state entities in the macos-def_inetlisteningservers_test.xml file to resolve validation errors. 
* Updated the oval-def_split_function.xml files so that they now utilize the ability to specify the empty string value in a constant_variable. 
* Added ind-def_textfilecontent_test.xml to the Windows content. 
* Added oval_check_enumeration_object_state.xml to the Windows content.

* Added win-def_wmi57_object_test.xml to the Windows content. 
* Commented out the test case that uses the 'not equal' operation in win-def_file_test.xml because it takes a very long time to complete. 
* Removed trailing path separators from all content. 
* Updated win-def_user_sid55_test.xml so that it no longer checks for the system account (S-1-5-18).
