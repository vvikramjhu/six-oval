In this document, we show the details
of SIX OVAL Web services.
In the latest version,
we provide only the _repository services_.

T.B.D.

The resources in the OVAL domain are well-defined in 
[http://oval.mitre.org/language/ the OVAL Language specification].
Currently, XML is one and only 
standardized resource representation format.
Therefore, we adopt these resource model and representation.

Below, we describe the resource identifier design with URIs
and interaction design with HTTP requests and responses. 


= <font color="#0044CC">Repository Services</font> =

Suppose that the base URI of the service is
denoted as `$REPO_BASE`;
e.g. `http://foo.org/six-oval/repository`.
