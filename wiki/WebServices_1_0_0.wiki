= <font color="#0044CC">Introduction</font> =

In this document, we show the details
of SIX OVAL Web services.
In this version, 1.0.0,
we provide only the _repository services_.



== <font color="#0044CC">REST API</font> ==
The main parts of REST-style Web services are
resource models, identifiers of the resources, 
representation of the resources, and 
interaction models.

The OVAL resource model is well-defined in 
[http://oval.mitre.org/language/ the OVAL Language specification].
Currently, XML is one and only 
standardized resource representation format
of the OVAL resources.
Therefore, it is natural 
that we adopt these model and representation format.

Below, we describe the resource identifier design with URIs
and interaction design with HTTP requests and responses. 
Please note that only distinctive HTTP headers
are listed.

= <font color="#0044CC">Repository Services</font> =

The OVAL repository is a persistent storage 
which contains the OVAL resources.
The repository services provide REST APIs
to access the repository with HTTP.


Suppose that the base URI of the service is
denoted as `$REPO_BASE`;
e.g. `http://foo.org/six-oval/repository`.
