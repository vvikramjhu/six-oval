#summary MongoDB installation and configuration.

= Introduction =

In this page, 
we describe the step-by-step process to install MongoDB 
on Windows platform.
Please read the official 
[http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Quickstart Installation Guides] 
on various kinds of platforms.



= Installation and Configuration Process =

T.B.D.

== 1 Download the Distribution Archive and Extract ==

Download the appropriate archive from the 
[http://www.mongodb.org/downloads downloads page].
The file looks like mongodb-win32-x86_64-2.0.6.zip
for Windows 64-bit platforms.

Extract the archive file into the appropriate location.
Rename the directory if necessary.


== 2 Create the Data Directory ==

MongoDB requires a directory to store 
its database files.
The default is *C:\data\db*.
Create the directory if you want to change the location.

Start the server, i.e. execute the *mongod* command. 
The data directory is specified with *--dbpath* option.

Connect to the server using the MongoDB shell,
*mongo* command,
in another Windows command shell.
Then, create an administrator account.

Change the target database to *oval* and
create a user for it.
In the following example, 
the user name and password are "six" and "six".

With MongoDB, we don't need to create a database 
explicitly.



== 4 Verify the Environment ==

Restart the server with the secure mode,
with *--auth* option.

Then, reconnect to the server with authentication information;
user name and password.
