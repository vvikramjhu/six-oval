                  OVAL Test Content

 Copyright (c) 2002 - 2012 - The MITRE Corporation

****************************************************

The MITRE Corporation developed the OVAL Test Content to provide 
the OVAL Community with a simple way to test the capability of 
OVAL Definition Evaluators. After running the OVAL Test Content 
through an OVAL Definition Evaluator, the OVAL Results will show 
the user which tests are properly supported by that tool. This 
allows users to perform unit testing of tools against the OVAL
Language. Over time, the OVAL Test Content will cover the basic 
behavior of all tests and capabilities in the OVAL Language.

You may download the OVAL Test Content to any computer you wish, 
and to as many computers as you wish.  

BY USING THE OVAL TEST CONTENT, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, 
DO NOT USE THE OVAL TEST CONTENT.  SEE THE TERMS.TXT FILE INCLUDED 
WITH THE OVAL TEST CONTENT.
